  %h2 Call for Speakers
  %br
  We are seeking proposals to speak at Link-State 2015 from individuals with
  professional and technical experience in any field that would be of benefit to
  students interested in computer science, programming, computer or electrical
  engineering. We have had open source project maintainers, engineers,
  designers, and students present at past conferences and hope to represent as
  many computer-related fields as we can fit. Our talks are 1-hour sessions,
  including Q&A, that take place in the lecture spaces of the Agnar Pytte
  Science Center. Contact #{ mail_to "hacsoc-officers@case.edu", "the team", subject:"CWRU Hacker Society Link-State 2015 Speaking Opportunities" }
  for more information about speaking at Link-State 2015.

  add variety from speakers who would prefer to commit to a smaller
  presentation. If you have a proposal for a lightning talk, fill out our
  #{link_to("Google Form", "http://goo.gl/forms/3Fv6KFBnKR")} and we will get
  back to you soon!
